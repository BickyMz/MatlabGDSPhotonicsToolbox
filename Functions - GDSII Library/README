All functions in this toolbox are in the Public Domain, with the following
exceptions:

- Boolean/clipper.hpp and Boolean/clipper.cpp are subject to the
  Boost Software license 1.0: http://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt

- Structures/private/datamatrixmex.c is subject the GNU Public

- Basic/gdsio/convert_float_gcc.h is subject to the GNU Public
  License version 3: http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html
  NOTE: This file is only used when the toolbox is compiled with
  GCC, otherwise 'convert_float_generic.h' is used instead, which
  is in the Public Domain.


New versions of the toolbox can be downloaded from:

These functions are particularly useful when a layout is the result 
of a computation. MATLAB / Octave can then be used as a macro language
for writing the layout. 


Functions
=========
Toolbox functions are grouped into the following directories:

Basic:
    Contains the low level functions for reading and writing
    of files in GDS II stream format and defines objects and
    methods for working with GDS II layouts.

Elements:
    Contains functions that return gds_element objects.

Structures:
    Contains functions that return gds_structure objects

Boolean: 
    The GDS II toolbox contains a method that performs boolean
    set operations on boundary elements. This is described in more
    detail in the file: README-Boolean / README-Boolean.pdf

Misc:
    Functions that don't return gds_* objects.
    
Scripts:
    Command line scripts for Octave that can be run directly
    from the shell prompt in a Linux / Unix environment.


Compiling
=========
This software contains several MEX functions, which must be 
compiled with a C compiler (and a C++ compiler for the Clipper
library), before the library can be used. The C compiler must be
sufficiently C99 conformant; the LCC compiler that is included with
earlier versions of MATLAB will not compile many of the mex functions
(see the MATLAB documentation for compiling external functions).

For Octave, the mex functions are compiled by executing 

$ ./makemex-octave

at the shell prompt. In MATLAB the mex functions can be compiled by
changing to the ./gdsii directory and running

>> makemex

at the MATLAB command prompt. 


Useful Stuff
============
Very good viewer and editor for GDS II files: http://www.klayout.de
